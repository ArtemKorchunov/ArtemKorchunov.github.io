ABOUT ME

In my role as a software engineer, I greatly value the collaboration with my team. I believe that working together often leads to better results than what we could achieve individually. My experience has involved a mix of working independently and as part of a team, handling everything from the initial planning stages of projects to overseeing their completion. I'm keen on contributing to a positive team dynamic and leading by example, with the goal of enhancing our collective success. Additionally, I'm focused on improving my emotional intelligence, which I see as key to becoming more self-aware and better understanding my colleagues. This not only helps in creating a more inclusive and supportive work environment but also contributes to our team’s overall achievements.
